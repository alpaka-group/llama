/// \mainpage LLAMA API documentation
///
/// LLAMA is a C++17 template header-only library for the abstraction of memory access patterns. It distinguishes
/// between the view of the algorithm on the memory and the real layout in the background. This enables performance
/// portability for multicore, manycore and gpu applications with the very same code.
///
/// In contrast to many other solutions LLAMA can define nested data structures of arbitrary depths and is not limited
/// only to struct of array and array of struct data layouts. It is also capable to explicitly define padding,
/// blocking, striding and any other run time or compile time access pattern simultaneously.
///
/// To archieve this goal LLAMA is split into mostly independent, orthogonal parts completely written in modern C++17
/// to run on as many architectures and with as many compilers as possible while still supporting extensions needed
/// e.g. to run on GPU or other many core hardware.
///
/// This page documents the API of LLAMA. The user documentation and an overview about the concepts and ideas can be
/// found here: https://llama-doc.rtfd.io
///
/// LLAMA is licensed under the LGPL3+.
