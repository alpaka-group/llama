This example is a LLAMA version from the IO benchmark found here:
https://github.com/jblomer/iotools/blob/master/lhcb.cxx

The lhcb analysis example requires an input file, which can be downloaded here:
https://root.cern/files/RNTuple/

The file is typically called B2HHH~zstd.ntuple

If you get an error due to a version incompatibility of the file, try this workaround:
